## Installation

### Requirements

- [Python 3.8 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyENet](https://github.com/kajob-dev/pyenet) (If installing growtopia.py from PyPI)

### Installing from source

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal in the repository's directory
3. Install it using pip.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kaJob-dev/growtopia.py.git
cd growtopia.py

pip(3) install -U .
```

### Installing from PyPI

Please do note that installing growtopia.py from PyPI will require you to install [PyENet](https://github.com/kajob-dev/pyenet) yourself, as PyPI does not support direct dependencies. This'll be resolved in the future by simply having [PyENet](https://github.com/kajob-dev/pyenet) available in PyPI too.

```powershell
pip(3) install growtopia.py
```
